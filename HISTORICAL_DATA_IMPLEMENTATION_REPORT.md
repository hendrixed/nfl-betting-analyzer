   - Handles season-specific variations and position requirements
   - Maps legacy terminology to standardized formats

3. **Player Identity Resolver** (`player_identity_resolver.py`)
   - Resolves player identity conflicts across seasons
   - Uses name similarity, position consistency, and team history
   - Creates canonical master player records and mappings

4. **Comprehensive Matchup Analyzer** (`comprehensive_matchup_analyzer.py`)
   - Generates detailed team and positional matchup profiles
   - Analyzes game-level factors and historical head-to-head data
   - Provides matchup multipliers for enhanced predictions

5. **Historical Trend Analyzer** (`historical_trend_analyzer.py`)
   - Identifies player performance trends and patterns
   - Analyzes situational performance (home/away, vs defenses)
   - Calculates predictive indicators (breakout/bust probability)

6. **Enhanced Database Models** (`database_models.py` updates)
   - Added historical validation tracking tables
   - Player identity mapping with metadata
   - Statistical terminology mapping per season
   - Historical validation reports and quality metrics

### ‚úÖ Validation and Testing Suite

1. **Environment Verification** (`verify_environment.py`)
   - Validates NFL conda environment setup
   - Verifies all required dependencies
   - Tests NFL data access and local module imports

2. **Lightweight Validation Suite** (`historical_validation_lite.py`)
   - Quick validation of standardized data quality
   - Checks player consistency and statistical completeness
   - Generates actionable recommendations

3. **Process Monitoring** (`monitor_standardization.py`)
   - Monitors ongoing standardization processes
   - Tracks database growth and log file progress
   - Provides real-time status updates
