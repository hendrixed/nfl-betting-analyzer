# Snapshot CSV Schemas

This document defines the minimal, canonical headers for snapshot CSVs written to `data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

These headers are enforced by:
- CLI command: `nfl_cli.py snapshot-verify` (uses `--repair` to autofix headers)
- Central mapping: `core/data/ingestion_adapters.py` â†’ `SNAPSHOT_MIN_COLUMNS`

Keep this document and the code mapping in sync. Tests assert these exact headers for some files.

## Reference (for tests and tooling)

```

- stadiums.csv
```
["stadium_id","name","city","state","lat","lon","surface","roof","elevation"]
```

```

## Notes

- Files may be header-only (zero data rows). Tests accept header-only files.
- Additional snapshot files may exist; only files listed here are subject to header enforcement in tests/CLI.
- `snapshot-verify --repair` will create or rewrite files with header-only content using these exact headers.
